## Mono Repo vs Poly Repo

Mono repo should apply for most cases since they reduce the amount of work to keep library in sync and also make it easier to work on issues that span multiple libraries

Poly repo is used when you have to break a piece out because multiple places are using them

Mono and poly are not exclusive, you can have a repo that can multiple libraries that are meant to be used together
