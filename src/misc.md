### To Play When Bored

Below is a list of games that is fun to play when bored, they are determined through experience, a lot of games can be gotten temporarily really cheap through `Origin Access`:

- Red Alert 3: Lots of cool units and the control ergonomics is good.

### Not to Play

These are games that at first seem interesting but has some quirk that can ruin the experience:

- Battle Realms: Controlling units can be a pain, quite some work to divide troops between offense and defense. Doesn't work on the Windows 10 Qemu VM.
- Red Alert 2: The age really makes the game seem pretty sluggish to run.
- Command and Conquer General Zero Hour: Cool units but the path finding is pretty bad, leading to needing a lot of micromanaging to make units move correctly.
