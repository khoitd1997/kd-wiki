# Cooking

Most of the recipes use the `instant pot`. The saute function is usable although the shape and ergonomics of the pot make oil handling more difficult

## Tested Recipes

- [Beef Stew][1]
- [Spaghetti][2]: Pretty simple, put the meatballs at the bottom and the pasta on top, it's okay if the pasta touch the bottom of the instant pot. Use a can of tomato paste for each batch and make sure they are diluted, put enough water so that it's near the top of the meatball. High pressure for about 10 minutes
- [Sweet and Spicy Brisket][3]
- [Tacos][4]
