# PCB and Mechanical Design

## Mechanical

- Surveys of various free Mechanical CAD:
  - _Fusion360_: Fully online and free for hobbyist, `the one to use`.
  - FreeCAD: FOSS but seems fairly immature and has weird workflow.
  - OnShape: Very similar to Solidworks and also fully online, not sure how stable it is though.

## PCB

- Surveys of various free Electrical CAD:
  - _KiCAD_: FOSS and got some pretty big investments, `the one to use`.
  - Eagle: Heard their pricing tiers have gotten really complicated so the free tier is even more stripped down, but probably use it if designing enclosure in conjunction with Fusion360.
  - CircuitStudio and Upverter: Both fully online CAD by Altium, they honestly kind of compete against each other. Show that Altium strategy is lacking focus.

- [CadLab for visual diff on PCB](4)

## Both

- ECAD and MCAD Integration: Allow syncing between pcbs and enclosures design, [Fusion360 and Eagle](1), [KiCad Stepup and FreeCAD](2)
