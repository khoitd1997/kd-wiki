# GPU Programming

This is a pretty interesting area, and it seems to be fairly in demand(just check r/cpp job board, like 70% of the jobs involve CUDA or openCL). However, it also requires advanced degree, lots of math, and years of experience, thus, it's probably best to focus on other areas unless there is a significant change in the field.

It was mentioned that the thing that takes the year of experience is not the CUDA API itself but the understanding of its architecture and the understanding of the problem in order to make the solution run efficiently on Nvidia hardware.
