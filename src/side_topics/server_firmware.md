There is a big open source movement going on with players like Google and Facebook pushing for open source BIOS for projects like [LinuxBoot(uses Linux as later stage bootloader)][1]. The goal of having open source firmware for this is to increase security as well as extensibility.

[Open Computer Project Website][2] has a lot of cool specs that big companies design and manufacturers will follow that specs to make devices. Good for checking out why things the way they were
