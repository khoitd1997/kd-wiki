# 3D Printing

Got an Ender 3 in May 2020 because it's one of the cheapest while also having one of the biggest communities.

## Mods and Enhancements

### Completed

- Octo Print(as well as Cura integration)
- New Marlin firmware

### TODO

## Troubleshooting

[This page](4) is an excellent tool for visual diagnostic.

[Another page](6) pairing symptoms with solutions.

## Calibrations

[This video](3) has a pretty thorough list of things to check.

There are not that many things, and they are to be done _per material_:

- [Extruder Steps(esteps)](1)
- [Temperature](2)
- [Flow Rate](5)

[Good video about not calibrating too many things](7)

Calibration data:

| Material             | Esteps(steps/mm) | Temperature(C) | Flow Rate(%) | Calibration Date |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Hatchbox True Silver | 98.9             |                | 105          | 05/21/2020       |
